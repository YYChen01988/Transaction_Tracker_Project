Spending Tracker
Build an app that allows a user to track their spending.

MVP
$The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail
$The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete tags for their spending, e.g. groceries,  entertainment, transport
$The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
$The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.

Inspired by:
Monzo, MoneyDashboard, lots of mobile/online banking apps

Possible Extensions

$Transactions should have a timestamp, and the user should be able to view transactions sorted by the time they took place.
The user should be able to supply a budget, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they are nearing this budget or have gone over it.
The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.
